# Advent Of Code 2024 ðŸŽ… ðŸŽ„ â˜ƒ

My attempts at the Advent Of Code 2024 exercises! Solutions are in Rust this year, with the intention to rewrite in other languages if I get time.

You can see my solutions for previous years:

## Running Solutions

### Rust

Each day of the exercise is in its own crate, with tests that cover the examples. You can run these with `cargo test`.
